## Next items
* Observations as of 4:30 PM Friday 9/29
* When there are fewer facts available, someting like "Who is Jeff Hwang" is easier to align
* When there are a lot of facts available, e.g., like for George Washington, training doesn't seem to do much because the "weight" of all the facts out there outweigh what a few most recent trains can do
* See if we can *tilt* the style of the generated output into the style of Virgina Woolf, Ernest Hemingway, Emily Dickinson, Jane Austen, Toni Morisson
* Be mindful of the fact that Toni Morrison's work is under copyright

### Rough notes 
* More thoughts. Can we have a presidential bot-off?
* Compare how do Jefferson versus Franklin vs Lincoln vs FDR sound?
* baseline. See how ChatGPT does when prompted to talk with them?
* Synthetic data generation for RAG
	Use Use GPT4- API to select 100 topics for personal letters for US president 
* y shaped diagram
* Industry standard technique. Ask which one sounds more like Ben Frnaklin asking ChatGPT 
	* like chat GAN
	* when humans judge quality of output and GPT4 does as well, GPT4 quality is 95% as good.
* Justin quote: 'RLHF used to only be availble to the richest companies. But in a few months there will be more available.'
