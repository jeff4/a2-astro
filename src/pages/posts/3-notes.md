### Next steps
1. complete - <s>Ask phind, GPT, and others about a good "Once upon a time story"</s>
1. After trying to develop a story from phind.com, GPT-4, and pi.ai, i was dissatisfied with all of them. After some dialogue with these bots, decided to go with little red riding hood.
1. Let's go with Little Red Riding Cap.
1. test to see what styles can be produced from Hemingway, Jane Austen, Shakespeare, etc.
1. See how native GPT does at this
1. See how 'nous-hermes2' does at this task and see how training helps this
1. Generate samples of stylistic text from Hemingway, Austen , Shakespeare, etc.




### Reading resources on Nous-Hermes
1. Read [Nous-Hermes thread](https://twitter.com/Teknium1/status/1682459395853279232?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1682459395853279232%7Ctwgr%5Ee2e857234d07d452699f1396d249e307c856468b%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redditmedia.com%2Fmediaembed%2F155wwrj%2F%3Fresponsive%3Dtrueis_nightmode%3Dtrue)

### Resources on Fine-Tuning and RAG
1. [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iOJD1hw2xaw) by Fahd Mirza. Three ways of final adjustments to a foundation model:
	1. Prompt Engineering. Zero-shot vs. Few-Shot Learning
	1. Fine-Tuning. Instruction-based vs. Domain-based
	1. RAG. Process includes:
		1. Gathering data from data sources and extracting data
		1. Transforming data into appropriate format  
		1. Embedding this data in vector format and loading into a vector DB

## Observations as of 4:30 PM Friday 9/29
* When there are fewer facts available, someting like "Who is Jeff Hwang" is easier to align
* When there are a lot of facts available, e.g., like for George Washington, training doesn't seem to do much because the "weight" of all the facts out there outweigh what a few most recent trains can do
* See if we can *tilt* the style of the generated output into the style of Virgina Woolf, Ernest Hemingway, Emily Dickinson, Jane Austen, Toni Morisson
* Be mindful of the fact that Toni Morrison's work is under copyright

## Thursday 9/28/2023
### Rough notes 
* More thoughts. Can we have a presidential bot-off?
* Compare how do Jefferson versus Franklin vs Lincoln vs FDR sound?
* baseline. See how ChatGPT does when prompted to talk with them?
* Synthetic data generation for RAG
	Use Use GPT4- API to select 100 topics for personal letters for US president 
* y shaped diagram
* Industry standard technique. Ask which one sounds more like Ben Frnaklin asking ChatGPT 
	* like chat GAN
	* when humans judge quality of output and GPT4 does as well, GPT4 quality is 95% as good.
* Justin quote: 'RLHF used to only be availble to the richest companies. But in a few months there will be more available.'
