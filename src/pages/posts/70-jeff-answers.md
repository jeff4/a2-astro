### New resources
* [List of Gradient AI models](https://docs.gradient.ai/docs/models-1). Currently using Nous-Hermes-Llama2-13b. Consider using Llama-2 7B in the future.
* Format of the [instructions for fine-tuning](https://docs.gradient.ai/docs/cli-quickstart)  -- skip to *Prepare your dataset* section.
* More resources on proper formatting at [brev.dev](https://brev.dev/blog/fine-tuning-llama-2-your-own-data)

### Running colab 2d - 2e
* write simple function to simplify duplicated code
* Same prompts as yesterday
* duplicated code to ask multiple questions


***
## Trying multiple before/after questions
* Trying smaller set of more focused facts. No more mention of Mandarin learning, former employers. Instructions mostly include facts about 'Jeff likes math'
* **Query: Who are Jeff Hwang and Mark Zuckerberg?**


### 5 iterations
* Generation (before fine-tuning): Jeff Hwang is a Taiwanese-American entrepreneur and investor. Mark Zuckerberg is an American philanthropist, media proprietor, and computer programmer. He is known for co-founding Facebook, Inc.
* Generation (after fine-tuning): Jeff Hwang is a popular mathematician and educator who is known for his work in the field of mathematics. Mark Zuckerberg is a philanthropist and business magnate who is known for co-founding Facebook, Inc.

## Notes from Sunday, 10/01/2023

* Baseline: Existing top-of-the-line LLMs have a mix of pre-2021 trained data and more recently updated (perhaps via fine-tuning or RAG answers) to the question "Who is Jeff Hwang?"
* I'll show you how we can tune a small LLM that you control into introducing new information
