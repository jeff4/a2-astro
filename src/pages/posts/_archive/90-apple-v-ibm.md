* History of why the first IBM PC was limited to 640KB of RAM. ['Why Were PCs Limited to 640K of RAM (And How Did They Fix It)?'](https://www.howtogeek.com/why-were-pcs-limited-to-640k-of-ram-and-how-did-they-fix-it/)
	* See this quite good more detailed [technical article](https://www.xtof.info/the-640k-memory-limit-of-ms-dos.html#:~:text=The%20640K%20ceiling&text=A%20huge%20amount%20in%201981,the%20BIOS%20and%20the%20peripherals.) about how memory worked in the early IBM PCs
	* the first IBM PC had a 8088 processor that had a 20-bit addres bus allowing access to 1MB of memory. see [quora answer](https://qr.ae/pKh3rt)
* See also Excel sheet with bit and byte calculations
* Good article about the capabilities of System/360 IBM mainframes vs. the humble Apple I.
* Good article about the capabilities of System/360 IBM mainframes vs. the humble Intel microprocessor.
	* Intel's 8088, introduced in 1978, could by default address 64k of RAM. In contrast IBM could address 4GB of RAM. 64 thousand vs. 4 BILLION. aka 64 vs. 4 million.
	* Intel's 8088 could only do integer arithemetic below -32,768 to +32,768, aka 0 to 65,535.
	* in contrast, the IBM system 370 could process numbers between -2 billion to +2 billion, aka 0 to about 4 Billion.
* The ["holy trinity of 1977"](https://cybernews.com/editorial/the-1977-trinity-and-other-era-defining-pcs/) were:
	* **The Commodore PET** ($795 now about $4000 in 2023 dollars). Debuted in January 1977.
    * **The Apple II**, launched in June 1977 and discontinued by 1979. One of the first such machines to be able oto display multiple colors. Priced at $1300 in 1977, equivalent to $6,600 in 2023 dollars.
	* **The Tandy TRS-80**, sold by Tandy/RadioShack. TRS = Tandy / Radio Shack 80 computer.  Even though the company expected to sell only a few hundred machines, 10,000 TRS-80’s were sold in the first month of its release and over 100 thousand in two years after.  Such performance was a humongous achievement. For example, Commodore PET sold around 5,000 units in 1978 and was considered a success. One reason for RadioShack’s success was pricing. TRS-80 sold for $600 ($3,000 in 2020) with a monitor, meaning one Apple II cost as much as two TRS-80’s.

## TRS-80
* built around the [Zilog Z80](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zilog_Z80) 8-bit microprocessor

## Commodore PET
* initial PET 2001 released in 1977 was built around the [MOS Technology 6502](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOS_Technology_6502) which was an 8-bit microprocessor

## Apple II
* First release, similar to the PET, used the [MOS Technology 6502](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOS_Technology_6502) which was an 8-bit microprocessor
* from this [Apple Insider article](https://appleinsider.com/articles/20/04/18/how-apple-owes-everything-to-its-1977-apple-ii-computer),had 4 KB of RAM, could be expanded to 48 KB if you used all 16-kb RAM chips in it's 3 slots. See this [quora answer](https://qr.ae/pKh6iq).
	* [Descipription](https://americanhistory.si.edu/collections/search/object/nmah_334638#:~:text=The%20Apple%20II%20used%20a,graphics%20and%20a%20color%20monitor.) by the National Museum of American History.

## IBM System/370 Model 168
* According to [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_System/370_Model_168), main memory could be purchased with 1 - 8 MB.

* Search for "Model 148" in this [IBM FAQ](https://www.ibm.com/ibm/history/reference/faq_0000000011.html) and you will find this answer: "The Model 148 of the System/370 computer family was developed and manufactured at IBM's System Products Division facility in Endicott, N.Y., rolled out in June 1976 and first shipped during the first quarter of 1977. It enabled the users of intermediate-sized computers of the day to design larger, more efficient interactive, database and data communications applications. The machine had a maximum main memory of two million characters with internal performance speeds up to 43 percent faster than the earlier Model 145. The Model 148 was withdrawn from marketing in November 1983.	"

Main memory of 2 million characters, perhaps 2m bytes.


* [according to this article](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/zos-basic-skills?topic=storage-brief-history-virtual-64-bit-addressability), teh System/370 could address storage addresses up to 24 bits in length, aka the highest accessible address was 2^24 = 16,777,216. or technically that minus one = 16,777,215.
